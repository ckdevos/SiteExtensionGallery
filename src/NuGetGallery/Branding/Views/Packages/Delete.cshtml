    Unlisting a Site Extension hides it from search results, gallery and all NuGet commands, but it
    is still available for download.

            Unchecking this box means your Site Extension cannot be installed directly and it will
            not show up in search results.

<h2>Why can&#8217;t I delete my Site Extension?</h2>
<p>
    Site Extensions Gallery is based on the source code of <a href="https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery">NuGet Gallery</a>.
    Deleting a NuGet package is not supported by NuGet Gallery. 
</p>
<p>
    If you need the package permanently removed, click on the <a href="@Url.Action(actionName: "ReportAbuse", controllerName: "Packages", routeValues: new { id = Model.Id, version = Model.Version })" title="Contact Support">Contact Support</a> link and we'll take care
    of it for you. PLEASE ONLY DO THIS IF THERE IS AN URGENT PROBLEM WITH THE PACKAGE.
    (Passwords, malicious code, etc). Even if you remove it, it's prudent to immediately
    reset any passwords/sensitive data you accidentally pushed instead of waiting for us to delete
    the package.
